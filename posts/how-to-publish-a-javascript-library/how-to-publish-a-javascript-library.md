## Node Package Manager

In case you didn't know, npm is the package manager for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

The [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.

`npm` is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.

In this post I'm going to explain the basics of publishing a package to npm, but also how you to use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) ([Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) meta-framework) to make packaging and publishing a library to npm easier.

## Creating Your First Package

You can publish any piece of code to npm, from simple utility functions, to libraries, and frameworks, so don't think of npm as this serious thing (you only have to look at [is-odd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-odd) with **300,000+** monthly downloads ðŸ˜‚).

The only thing you have to do is [sign up for an account on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/signup).

After you're done, let's start by creating your first package.

You can use `npm init`, which is going to prompt you to answer questions related to your package, and create a `package.json` file.

```shell:terminal
npm init
```

I'm going to create a basic `package.json` by hand instead, because most [package.json fields](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) aren't relevant.

The only important field inside `package.json` is the name of the package, and the version number.

```json:greet/package.json showLineNumbers
{
  "name": "greet",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"main": "index.js",
	"type": "module"
}
```

You should respect [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) when updating your package, but it's not enforced by npm.

If you have a build step, you can change the default entry point of your program from `index.js`, to another path such as `dist/index.js`.

To use the modern JavaScript `import` syntax, you have to specify the `type` of your package as a `module`.

I'm going to create and export a simple `greet` function from `index.js`.

```js:greet/index.js showLineNumbers
export function greet() {
	console.log('hi')
}
```

You can run the script with `node index.js`, but it would be easier if you could import `greet` inside of another project as a regular package, to make sure it works.

## Testing Your Package

I'm going to create a `test` folder with a `package.json` file, which also needs to be a module to work with the `greet` package.

To test a package, you can use [npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-link).

Inside the `greet` package folder, run `npm link` to create a global link to the `greet` package.

```shell:terminal
npm link
```

You can run `npm ls --link --global` to see your linked packages.

```shell:terminal
â””â”€â”€ greet@0.0.1 -> ./../../../../../greet
```

To link the `greet` package in your project, run `npm link greet` inside `test`, which is going to link the `greet` package inside `node_modules`.

```shell:terminal
npm link greet
```

You can use `greet` like a regular package inside `test/index.js`.

```js:test/index.js
import { greet } from 'greet'

greet() // hi
```

You can run `npm unlink greet`, to remove the linked package from `test`.

```shell:terminal
npm unlink greet
```

You can run `npm uninstall -g greet`, to completely remove the package.

```shell:terminal
npm uninstall -g greet
```

If you use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), you can use [pnpm link](https://pnpm.io/cli/link) where `pnpm link -g` creates a link to a package, and `pnpm link -g greet` links the package.

## Publishing Your Package

To publish a package to the npm registry, run the `npm publish` command in your terminal.

If you aren't signed in to npm, you're going to be prompted to do so.

```shell:terminal
npm publish
```

There's one problem though.

```shell:terminal
403 Forbidden
PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/greet
You do not have permission to publish "greet".
```

This package already exists!

So what now, do we have to rename the `greet` package to something unique? The answer is no â€” you can scope the package by [creating an organization on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/create).

Use the name of the organization you created.

```shell:terminal
{
	"name": "@joyofcode/greet",
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"main": "index.js",
	"type": "module"
}
```

If you try to publish the package now, it won't work because scoped packaged are private by default, which is a paid feature of npm.

```shell:terminal
 402 Payment Required
 PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@joyofcode%2fgreet
 You must sign up for private packages.
```

To [make your scoped package public](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-publish#access), you have to pass the `--access=public` flag.

```shell:terminal
npm publish --access=public
```

Your package is now available on npm, and ready to be installed with `npm i @joyofcode/greet`.

```shell:terminal
Publishing to https://registry.npmjs.org/ with tag latest and public access
+ @joyofcode/test@0.0.1
```

Congrats! ðŸŽ‰

## Unpublishing Your Package

If no project depends on your package, you have 72 hours to [unpublish your package from npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry).

```shell:terminal
npm unpublish @joyofcode/greet -f
```

This is because in the past some random person unpublished [left-pad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/left-pad), and broke the internet.

## Using SvelteKit To Package Libraries

In most cases your library isn't this simple, and you want things like TypeScript, testing, linting and formatting, which is a pain to set up.

Not only does SvelteKit make this easy, but you can also run the `package` command to package the `src/lib` contents into a `dist` directory, with your transpiled JavaScript files, and generated types.

To get started, run `npm create svelte`, pick the **library** template, and select the options you want.

```shell:terminal showLineNumbers
â”Œ  Welcome to SvelteKit!
â”‚
â—‡  Where should we create your project?
â”‚    (hit Enter to use current directory)
â”‚
â—‡  Which Svelte app template?
â”‚  Library project
â”‚
â—‡  Add type checking with TypeScript?
â”‚  Yes, using TypeScript syntax
â”‚
â—†  Select additional options (use arrow
keys/space bar)
â”‚  â—» Add ESLint for code linting
â”‚  â—» Add Prettier for code formatting
â”‚  â—» Add Playwright for browser testing
â”‚  â—» Add Vitest for unit testing
â””
```

Using the **library** template, `src/lib` becomes the main part of your app, and `src/routes` can be used for testing, and documentation.

Everything is already set up for you inside `package.json`. You can [read more about packaging](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/packaging) in the SvelteKit docs.

The most important fields are `exports` and `files`:

- `exports` help TypeScript and Svelte tooling know where their respective files are
- `files` is to let npm know what files to upload, and which ones to ignore

```json:package.json showLineNumbers
{
	"exports": {
		".": {
			"types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
			"svelte": "./dist/index.js"
		}
	},
	"files": [
		"dist",
		"!dist/**/*.test.*",
		"!dist/**/*.spec.*"
	]
}
```

There are legacy fields for `svelte`, and `types` which are safe to remove.

If you're not publishing a Svelte library, rename the **svelte** field to **default**.

```json:package.json {5} showLineNumbers
{
	"exports": {
		".": {
			"types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
			"default": "./dist/index.js"
		}
	}
}
```

You can also link and test your package the same way as before with `npm link`.

To package your library run `npm run package`.

```shell:terminal
npm run package
```

This is going to create a `dist` folder at the root, which is going to be uploaded to npm.

To publish the package, run `npm publish`, or `npm publish --access=public` if you have a scoped package.

You can build your docs with `npm run build`, and host it anywhere, like any regular SvelteKit site.

That's it! ðŸ˜„
