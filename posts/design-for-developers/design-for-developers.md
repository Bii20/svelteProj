## Misconception About Design

The greatest misconception about design is that one has to be **artistic**.

The purpose of design is to solve problems meaning it's [utilitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism), which is why design and development have more in common than you think.

You already know what great design is when you look at it — you just don't know how to reason about it because you lack the required vocabulary.

I'm not going to bore you with theory but give you actual tips you can use and see a drastic improvement. I'm not a professional designer but this is what I learned through experience and learning from others.

## The Four Principles of Design

The goal of design is to make things **easy to understand** in a **aesthetically pleasing** way.

**Design is C.R.A.P.** which stands for **contrast**, **repetition**, **alignment** and **proximity**. Remember this [mnemonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic) and always ask yourself if your design meets **C.R.A.P.** standards.

A lot of design principles are based from psychology such as the [gestalt principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principles_of_grouping) that describe how humans group similar elements and recognize patterns.

## Contrast

Contrast draws **attention**.

You can achieve **contrast** through **color**, **size** of text, and shapes to make elements look different. **Contrast** creates **visual hierarchy** meaning you know what is important on the page and in what order to read information.

{% img src="text-contrast.webp" alt="Text contrast" %}

Use **color** to increase or reduce contrast for text that isn't important, or reduce **eyestrain**.

You can use a shade of gray on a white background but don't do the same on a **colored** background when you're trying to **de-emphasize** text.

In that case you should pick the same background color and adjust the **contrast**.

{% img src="color-contrast-bad.webp" alt="Bad text contrast" %}

The contrast has to pass [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), and has three levels of conformance ranging from **A**, **AA** to **AAA**.

{% img src="color-contrast-good.webp" alt="Good text contrast" %}

Use the developer tools to check the contrast ratio.

{% img src="contrast-checker.webp" alt="Contrast checker in developer tools" %}

## Repetition

Repetition creates **consistency** in your design.

Using a **consistent** style for your elements creates **rhythm** by repeating the same **font**, **size**, and **color** which makes your content more readable.

{% img src="repetition.webp" alt="Repetition" %}

You've probably seen one of these landing pages that lets you know there's more content on the page.

{% img src="scroll-more-idiot.webp" alt="Mouse indicating scrolling" %}

A more clever use of design would be using the line from the logo to establish **repetition**. If you look closely none of the elements are placed randomly but with purpose. I'm going to talk more about this in **alignment**.

{% img src="repetition-scrolling-heading.webp" alt="Using a design element to indicate scrolling" %}

This entices the reader of your content to explore more. The number is mostly a design element, and doesn't have to have meaning, unless you want to establish **repetition** by numbering every section.

{% img src="repetition-scrolling-area.webp" alt="Using a design element to indicate scrolling" %}

The more you look at design, the more you're going to pick up on these details.

## Alignment

Alignment is used to **organize information** creating order.

Design decisions should be **intentional** and not arbitrary. When elements are aligned, they visually connect to each other and serve as an **anchor** for your eyes through an **invisible line** created from **alignment**.

Great design is in the details.

A often **mistake** you can make is **centering** everything, and not constraining the width of the text which makes it hard to read.

{% img src="alignment-bad.webp" alt="Bad alignment" %}

The difference is stark using only **left alignment**.

{% img src="alignment-good.webp" alt="Good alignment" %}

You can enable the grid in a design tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I'm using a **twelve column grid** since that's the most frequently used one.

You can use [CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) to create the same grid for your site, making translating designs easy.

Let me show you the **invisible line** I mentioned earlier.

{% img src="alignment-grid.webp" alt="Alignment grid overlay" %}

You should always have a strong **horizontal** or **vertical** line because it anchors your eye.

The **alignment** for the logo and navigation is also **intentional** being on the **baseline**. This **isn't** to say that centering is bad — you can center short text, but long text is hard to read. I'm going to cover more on **typography** later.

Once you learn enough design fundamentals, you can break the rules to create more interesting design. Having everything on a grid can feel rigid, and boring. To make the design more interesting, images are often used to break outside the grid, which looks great because it's **intentional**.

Bad design is design that looks **unintentional**.

Let's look at the design of [Apple.com](https://www.apple.com/) to see how they "break the rules". You can observe how design is used to create interest where the products break the monotonous grid. Because the rest of the design is on a grid, and aligned perfectly it looks **intentional**, and not like a mistake.

{% img src="apple-grid.webp" alt="Apple.com grid overlay" %}

## Proximity

Proximity is **grouping related things together**.

Use **proximity** instead of spacing everything **evenly**.

{% img src="proximity.webp" alt="Proximity" %}

Proximity lets you brain group related information together, so it appears as **one visual unit** instead of feeling **unrelated**.

{% img src="proximity-outline.webp" alt="Outline around elements showing proximity" %}

## Layout

Before you do anything, use **a piece of paper**, or a design tool to draw **wireframes** which are just simple boxes that represent your layout to avoid a lot of problems.

{% img src="wireframe.webp" alt="Wireframe" %}

Another mistake is having your site look like it's made out of boxes by using a different background colors for every section. Use a more subtle shade of color instead to separate the content with subtle borders.

Layout is not easily taught, and has to be practiced.

If you want to create unique designs you have to look at inspiration on sites such as [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/), [Behance](https://www.behance.net/) , [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) or [Lapa](https://www.lapa.ninja/) and learn from recreating designs. Expose yourself to great design by using a new tab extension for your browser like [Panda](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panda-5-your-favorite-web/haafibkemckmbknhfkiiniobjpgkebko).

Using a grid is going to make you realize how everything in design is **intentional**.

This isn't always the case because a lot of great looking design isn't always professional design. You're going to notice this a lot when looking at amateur design that has aesthethics, but it's not practical.

You can take this boring landing page, and use design to add some **visual interest**. Do as many layout ideas as you want.

{% img src="wireframe-landing-page.webp" alt="Landing page wireframe" %}

Don't try to make it look good, but just try out random ideas.

## Spacing

Great design is about consistency, and using the four principles of design to create a cohesive looking design.

{% img src="alignment-spacing.webp" alt="Alignment spacing" %}

## Typography

{% img src="typefaces.webp" alt="Typefaces" %}

Typography is important because it evokes emotion.

- **Serif** fonts have fancy decorations, which makes them popular in luxury brands, but they're also used in print from newspapers to books
- **Sans-serif** fonts lack the decorations, and are more legible for large text, and modern screens
- **Monospaced** fonts are fonts where every character has the same width

Having great looking typography isn't hard with a couple of rules:

- Use one of these [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): **Inter**, **Manrope**, **Montserrat**, **Poppins**
- Anything below **16 pixels** and **400** for the font weight is not readable
- Use a single **sans-serif** font and **weights** for contrast
- Skip a font weight for more **contrast** (**400, 600, 700, 900**)
- Use a **line height** between **150-180%** for text
- Don't forget to adjust the **line height** for titles
- Avoid using **absolute** color values like pure black and white as it's harsh on the eyes, so use a **shade** instead
- Add a subtle color to text to make it feel **cooler** or **warmer**

You don't need a [Fibonnaci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) generator to create a typography scale. Instead use **multiples of eight** meaning **8px**, **16px**, **24px**, **32px**, **64px**, and so on. This works great as a base unit for typography, and spacing inside a **8 point grid** system.

To use a **8 point grid** inside **Figma**, set your nudge value to **8px** .

Don't forget that you can turn these values into [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) for your typography and spacing for easy reuse in your project.

Even if I say "rules" don't take any of it as **gospel**. These are constraints to help you create a **consistent** looking design, and avoid mindless **pixel pushing**.

The optimal reading length for text is around **60 characters** but I prefer to go up to **80 characters**. You can set the `max-width` of your content to `60ch` in your **CSS**. One of the most important things for legible text is **line height**. I find a great **line height** to be from **150%** to **180%** or **1.5** to **1.8** in **CSS**.

Always test how your typography looks on **real text**, and don't forget to adjust your title's **line height** to compensate.

## Color

{% img src="color-wheel.webp" alt="Color wheel" %}

You don't have to understand color theory.

Find a **primary** color you like. From there find a **complementary** color that works together. If you're using **black** and **white** you're already using two colors. You can use **shades** of one color for a **monochromatic** color scheme, so you don't even need more colors.

To find a **complementary** color is simple — just pick the color opposite the **primary** color you picked on the **color wheel**.

{% img src="color-picker.webp" alt="Color picker" %}

I like the [color picker from Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) because it's simple, and you can learn more about color.

You can use the **60-30-10** color rule from interior design, where **60%** is the **main** color, **30%** is the **secondary** color, and **10%** is the **accent** color.

{% img src="color-palette.webp" alt="Color palette" %}

{% img src="color-rule.webp" alt="Color rule" %}

The **primary** color doesn't always have to be **60%**, and you can flip the values for different sections of your site.

The purple is taking around **60%**, and the white is taking up **30%**, while the accent color is taking up **10%** of the space.

## Conclusion

You learned enough visual design to be dangerous.

You also learned the vocabulary to talk about design more eloquently. If you stick to a couple of simple rules, you can be confident your design looks great.

If this ignited your passion for design I highly recommend reading [Refactoring UI](https://www.refactoringui.com/book) and [Design for Hackers: Reverse Engineering Beauty](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Hackers-Reverse-Engineering-Beauty/dp/1119998956).
